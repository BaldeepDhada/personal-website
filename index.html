<center><h2>About</h2>
I'm a first year Masters of Data Science student at the University of British Coloumbia.
I obtained a degree in Psychology and Biological Sciences <br> and did research with multiple labs during the course of my degree. 
I built leadership skills by leading a team of students to create a <br> 3D animation of a Neuroscience Software which won first place at the 2021 Neurotech Cup. 
I have clinical and laboratory research skills. <br>My goal is to work on a project in a team setting. 
 I'm interested in data science, machine learning and algorithms.</center>
